ACL2 modeling of ASL and CAT semantics
======================================

The asl subdirectory contains an interpreter for type-checked ASL
abstract syntax trees in ACL2. See the README.md file there for more
details and the installation process.

The cat subdirectory contains ACL2 modeling of the CAT language,
currently in an early stage.
