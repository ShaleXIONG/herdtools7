\section{BET2}

The following changes have been made.

\subsection{ASL-871: forbid \texttt{throw;}}

The bare \texttt{throw;} statement (without an expression that evaluates to the thrown exception) is no longer permitted.
The \texttt{throw e;} statement is still permitted.

\subsection{ASL-873: empty function bodies}

Subprogram bodies without any statements are now forbidden.
A \texttt{pass;} statement should be used to indicate an ``empty'' subprogram body.

\subsection{ASL-875: grammar of tuple types}

The grammar of tuple types has been adjusted to forbid ``empty'' tuple types (e.g. \texttt{()}).

\subsection{ASL-876: binary operator precedence}

\RequirementRef{OperatorPrecedence} has been updated to reflect the precedence in the ASLRef implementation.
In particular, ``relational'' operators are higher priority than ``equality-inequality'' and ``boolean'' operators.
